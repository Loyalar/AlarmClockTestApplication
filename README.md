# AlarmClockTestApplication
Proof-of-concept app to showcase BootCompleted and UserPresent receivers in Android.

This feature is used to register when a user has unlocked their phone, and execute code in that situation. This can for example be used to pull a status for an app without it being done when the user is not present.
